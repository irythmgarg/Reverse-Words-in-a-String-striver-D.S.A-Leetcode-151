Theory Explanation:
Reversing the entire string: The function reverse(s, 0, s.length() - 1) first reverses the entire string. This is the foundation for reversing the individual words within the string. Reversing the string is a crucial step because once we reverse the entire string, we just need to reverse the words individually to get the correct result.

Handling spaces:

The loop checks for leading spaces and removes them by adjusting the starting index (i).
Similarly, trailing spaces are removed by adjusting the ending index (k).
Within the loop, after processing a word, spaces are added between words unless the end of the string is reached.
Reversing words: After identifying the beginning and end of a word, it is reversed in place by calling reverse(s, p, j-1). This ensures that each word is placed in the correct order.

Trimming extra spaces: Once all words are processed and separated by single spaces, we use s.substr(0, j) to cut off any extra trailing spaces and get the final result.

Space Complexity:
Auxiliary Space: The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space (O(1)) for operations such as the temporary variables i, j, k, and p.
The reverse() function doesn't require extra space since it swaps the characters in place.
Final Space Complexity: O(1) for extra space used by the function, but the space complexity of the input string is O(n) where n is the length of the string. This is the space required to store the string itself, but it is not considered auxiliary space.
Time Complexity:
Reversing the entire string: The function reverse() is called once to reverse the whole string, which takes O(n) time.
Processing the words: In the worst case, the string may contain only one word (no spaces), and the entire string must be processed. In general, the string is processed in O(n) time, where n is the length of the string.
Sub-string operation: The operation s.substr(0, j) also takes O(n) time in the worst case.
Final Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string.
Overall Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
Space Complexity: O(1) auxiliary space, but the space used for the input string is O(n).
This solution is efficient both in terms of time and space.
